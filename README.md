# üéÅ GiftaMatic - An opensource web3 project to create donation campaigns .

The project allows people to create GiftaMatic Campaigns with a target amount and description. Then, they can generate a sharable link in public and anyone would be able to
donate MATIC from the shared link.

## How it works?

GiftaMatic connects to the [smart contract](./contracts/Gift.sol) deployed on Polygon's Mumbai TestNet which allows both 
 - The fundraisers to easily create campaigns and share them on social media
 - The donaters to trustfully donate to the campaign.

## What problems are we solving? 

GiftAMatic solves the biggest problem of transparency in donations and the middleman's involved in the process. The smart contract deployed on a decentralized network is immuatable and stores the records of transactions.

The amount payed using the application will be transferred to the campaign creator directly. 

Our platform creates a transparency for donation about a donation campaign like it's total amount deposited, address in which the amount is deposited and more.
The total amount raised , deposit address are always known to the donater to ensure the sense of trust

## Our Uniqueness

1) Incentivise the donaters by providing them our own crypto GFT in order to create a win-win situation for both the parties.
   The salient features of this tokens are :
    - These GFTs are non transferable.
    - They go along with the trend of showcasing the social status to the public.
 
2) Making sure the donaters know that the campaign is legitimate.
   We have build a npm package for creating a button that can be integrated in any website. 
   If the donator trust the website that integrated our button, then they will be assured that the campaing is legitimate.
